/**
 *这是Spring事务基础设施的中心接口。

 *应用程序可以直接使用它，但它主要不是作为API:

 *通常，应用程序将使用TransactionTemplate（编程式事务）或

 通过AOP进行声明性事务划分。
 *
 *
 对于实现者，建议继承

 * {@link org.springframework.transaction.support.AbstractPlatformTransactionManager}

 *类，它预先实现定义的传播行为并负责

 事务同步处理。子类必须实现

 *用于底层事务的特定状态的模板方法，

 *例如:begin, suspend, resume, commit。
 *
 *

 该策略接口的默认实现是

 * {@link org.springframework.transaction.jta。JtaTransactionManager},（XA分布式事务实现类默认）

 * {@link org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager}（本地事务一般使用这个）,

 *可作为其他事务策略的实现指南。
